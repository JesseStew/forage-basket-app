            â€‹There is a valid reason why two products with basically the exact
            same labeling of Organic, Therapeutic Quality, and All Natural can
            sell for $7.00 in one store and $20.00 in another.

        <p>
          I Am Essential Oils, living naturally and in harmony with nature is
          not only their passion, it is their way of life. The earth is abundant
          and nature is our birthright. The health and well-being of our
          community is directly correlated to our mutualistic relation with
          nature. Nature provides clues to easy living, such as how bees
          pollinate more efficiently than humans. At I Am Essential Oils they
          guide their day to day living, work, and business relations for the
          health of the planet.

        <p>
          For the most part, nature cultivates and sustains better than man-made
          systems. For example, the forest is a harmonious system which stores
          water as if a lake and sustains life naturally. As forests are cut
          down, the water that would have naturally been retained, now runs off
          or is evaporated. This departure of water creates arid conditions and
          leads to the loss of its vegetation and animal life. We can learn from
          nature and apply what we experience to create better long term health
          for the soil, and a healthier happier way of living for all living
          things. I Am Essential Oils finds that the small farms are more
          invested long term in soil quality.
