They regulate the body’s pH to prevent acidosis, an increase in acidity in the body, and maintain the body’s proper cellular alkalinity.  Because of modern farming practices and our modern diets, people are usually not getting the nutrition they need for optimal health.  I like to look towards herbs and superfoods to assist in giving my body the building blocks of good health and to achieve a homeostatic balance of the body’s chemistry.  Taking supper food drinks or green shots daily is a wonderful way to assist the body in getting the proper nutrition it needs.",

Due to a special process, the good aragonite crystalline calcium is able to be extracted out of the coral calcium.  It takes 13 pounds of regular coral calcium to make 1 pound of ionic crystalline calcium.  This extract is a very fine powder, only 3.3 microns in particle size.  The size, structure, and ionization of the calcium concentrate enables better absorption and effective calcium assimilation.  According to scientific studies by Dr. Yamauchi, our calcium concentrate is at least 6 times more soluble in water than that of calcium carbonate CaCO3.  It also does not build up in the system causing bone spurs and heart valve problems, like most all other calcium supplements.",
