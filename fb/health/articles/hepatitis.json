Many times, when the virus enters the body, there are no symptoms for awhile.  Liver infection is a common occurrence in all types of hepatitis and can be fatal if left untreated.",

It is spread by fecal-oral, poor sanitary conditions, poor personal hygiene, person-to-person contact, or by ingesting contaminated food or water.  This is usually prevented by immunizations, with their potential harmful side effects, or the proper modulation of the immune system through high quality supplements.",

This virus triggers the immune system to cause inflammation to the liver as the body tries to eliminate the virus and heal.  Having a strong immune system to fight the virus makes your chances of recovery very likely and the body develops a life-long immunity for the virus.",

RNA is a molecule that is similar to DNA and crucial in protein synthesis and other cell activities.)  This type of hepatitis is the leading cause of liver transplants.  Without proper immune system modulation the immune system will have a difficult time eliminating this virus.  The age risk group ranges from 40-60.  ",

This will trigger the immune system to cause inflammation of the liver.  (Inflammation is the bodyâ€™s immune systems first response to start the healing process).  Prolonged inflammation causes scarring of the liver which could eventually lead to cirrhosis and cause liver failure.",

Transmission is by infected blood, needles, and sexual contact with an infected person.

Without the proper building blocks, the immune system cannot do its job properly.  If you are deficient in nutrition, minerals, smoke, use alcohol or are surrounded by environmental toxins, or under stress; this can wear down the immune system.  Start by eating healthy, taking high quality immune modulation supplements like Shiaqga, drink more water, and exercise.",
